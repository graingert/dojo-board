* Thought of having the dimensions passed in a iterables; ie rather than
  passing a dimension size, you pass an iterable. But too inefficient, and
  confusing (what if an iterable had all the odd numbers?)

* Tried having a board slice be less dimensional than its parent;
  too many corner cases. Just use a slice where one of the dimensions
  is of size 1

* Also considered a slice with a negative stride, to "flip" the board along
  at least one dimension. Left for now but might come back later. Not clear
  what a cumulative effect would be

* Have dimensions be 1-based and/or allowing mapping between,
  eg letter (so "A:1") which feels more natural for, eg, Battleships?
